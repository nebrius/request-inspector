# Request Inspector example project

This example includes three separate microservices that work together to render a simple HTML page.

To run the example, run each of these four commands in a separate terminal:

```bash
request-inspector
node app.js
node render-microservice.js
node template-microservice.js
```

Then open one browser window at `http://localhost:3000`, then open another one at `http://localhost:7176`
